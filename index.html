     <h1>Psychology Evolution 101</h1>
     <p>
       Psychology Evolution 101 explores how the field of psychology has developed over time, 
       from its philosophical roots to the scientific discipline it is today. 
       Early thinkers like Plato and Aristotle laid the groundwork by pondering the nature of the mind and behavior.

       <h2>The Birth of Modern Psychology</h2>
     <p>
       In the late 19th century, psychology emerged as a formal science with Wilhelm Wundt’s first laboratory in Germany. 
       Wundt focused on introspection—examining one's own thoughts and feelings. This marked the beginning of psychology as an experimental and academic discipline.

     <h3>Key Schools of Thought</h3>
     <p>
       Over time, several schools of thought influenced psychological research and therapy. 
       Behaviorism emphasized observable behavior; psychoanalysis explored the unconscious mind; 
       humanism highlighted personal growth and potential; and cognitive psychology focused on mental processes.
     </p>

     <h2>Psychology Today</h2>

       Today, psychology is a diverse and evolving field. It integrates biological, social, cultural, and technological factors 
       to understand the human experience. From neuroscience to positive psychology, the field continues to expand and adapt.
