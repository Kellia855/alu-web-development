    Psychology Evolution 101 explores how the field of psychology has developed over time, 
    from its philosophical roots to the scientific discipline it is today. 
    Early thinkers like Plato and Aristotle laid the groundwork by pondering the nature of the mind and behavior. 
    In the late 19th century, psychology emerged as a formal science with Wilhelm Wundtâ€™s first laboratory,
    focusing on introspection. Over time, schools of thought like behaviorism, psychoanalysis, humanism,
    and cognitive psychology shaped the discipline, each adding new perspectives on how humans think, feel, and behave.
    Today, psychology is a diverse and evolving field that integrates biological, social, and cultural factors to understand the human experience.
